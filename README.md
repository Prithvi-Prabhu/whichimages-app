## which-images-app

 React Native App that allows user to select and upload images with category, and retrieve the same when required.

 ## Set up

 Set up React Native app using React Native CLI. Refer to React Native docs for environmental setup: [React Native docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)

 ```
npx react-native@latest init <Project>
cd <Project>
npm start
```

Set up an emulator on Android Studio for easy testing, steps provided in the docs.

## Dependencies

Install necessary dependencies for the app

```
npm install react react-native react-native-image-crop-picker axios react-native-modal-selector react-native-fs react-native-vector-icons react-native-elements @react-native-picker/picker react-native-gesture-handler
```

## Note:

For testing locally, spin up the backend to run on system ip address, ensure you provide required camera permissions for android and ios (found in android/app/src/AndroidManifest)
